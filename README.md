Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of aviation accidents involves examining and analyzing accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Key steps in this process include:

1.Data Collection: Gathering comprehensive data on aviation accidents, including factors like date, location, weather conditions, and aircraft details.
2.Data Cleaning: Preparing the data by handling missing values, correcting errors, and ensuring consistency.
3.Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics to understand the overall characteristics of the data, such as accident frequencies and severity.
4.Visualization: Creating charts and graphs, such as histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps, to visualize patterns and trends in the data, such as high-accident areas or peak times.
5.Correlation Analysis: Examining relationships between variables, such as the impact of weather conditions on accident rates.

Overall, EDA helps in understanding the underlying causes of accidents, guiding improvements in safety measures, and prioritizing areas for further investigation.
